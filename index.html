    <h3>History Of Indian Cinema</h3>
    <p>The history of cinema in India extends to the beginning of the film era. Following the screening of the Lumière
      and Robert Paul moving pictures in London in 1896, commercial cinematography became a worldwide sensation and
      these films were shown in Bombay (now Mumbai) that same year. The first full-length Indian films released in India
      were the Marathi-language silent films Shree Pundalik (1912, Dadasaheb Torne) and Raja Harishchandra (1913,
      Dadasaheb Phalke). Both were premiered at the Coronation Cinematograph in Bombay</p>
